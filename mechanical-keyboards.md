## Introduction - Keyboard types

### Membrane keyboards
- Found in traditional keyboards and laptops
- A membrane layer with conductive traces exists between the key and the circuit board
- When a key is pressed, it pushes down on membrane
- When the membrane (with its conductive trace) comes into contact with the circuit board, it activates the key
- Typical membrane keyboard types are
   - **rubber dome**: typically found on full size keyboards
   - **scissor switch**: typically found on laptops

### Mechnical keyboards

- Mechanical keyboards do not use a membrane but use an **individual mechanical switch for each key**
- When a key is pressed it pushes down on the stem/plunger of the switch (which is supported by a spring)
- When it reaches the actuation point it triggers a contact which the PCB  (printed circuit board) detects and the key is registered
- Key switches have different characteristics which make up one of the core ways the keyboard feels
- Traditionally keys have a physical switch but some variations uses light and are referred to as optical switches
- Mechanical Keyboards can be bought as a full working set or individual parts purchased and built from scratch

### Analog keyboards

- Analog keyboards allow a single key to have multiple actuation points thus a single key could be used to perform multiple actions (e.g. pressing a key down half way will give a lower case but pressing it down all the way will give an upper case)

## Parts of a Switch

- **Stem**: the part that key caps (the part of the key that has the character/function printed on it) connect to. When a key is pressed the stem gets pushed down
- **Cross point contact / leaf**: the circuitry that closes in order for the key to be registered by the PCB. Traditionally 2 pieces of metal that come into contact when the stem is pushed far enough
   - For optical switches this is replaced by a light mechanism and requires a specific PCB to support the optical mechanism
- **Spring**: pushes the stem up and provides the actuation force of a switch
- **Top housing**: the top of the switch where the stem protrudes out of
- **Bottom/Base housing**: the bottom of the switch that gets mounted on a plate/PCB and where the contacts with the PCB exit

## Typical Switch Characteristicis

- **Tactility**: When the key actuates, is there is a feel of a bump
- **Actuation distance**: How much distance is required until the key is activated
- **Actuation force**: How much force is needed to move the key to its actuation point in order to be registered
- **Key Travel**: How much distance when the key is fully pressed down i.e. bottomed out
- **Noise level**: Is there an audible click when the key actuates

## Typical Switch Types

https://keybumps.com/switch-list.html

- **Tactile**:
   - Feel a bump
   - _Example_: Cherry Browns
- **Clicky**:
   - Feel a bump
   - Hear a click
   - _Example_: Cherry Browns
- **Linear**:
   - No bump
   - No click
   - _Example_: Cherry Reds

### Some Switch Modifiers

- **Silent**: Added mods to make it quieter
- **Speed**: Lower actuation distances/force

## Switch Profiles

- This refers to the how tall the switches are
- **Traditional/Regular**:
   - What most mechanical keyboards will be and are typically taller and bulkier than non mechanical keyboards
- **Low profile**:
   - From the name, it is a lower profile / height and make the keyboard less bulky
   - Some low profile switches have different
      - pin positions thus will be limited to what PCBs they can work with
      - stems thus will be limited to what key caps

## Switchable

- **Hotswap**: keyboards that allow the key switches to be easily changed out without soldering. but it typically does require key switch pullers to help
- **Non-hotswap / Soldered**: key switches are soldered onto the circuit board. They can still be changed but requires lots of soldering

## Stems Styles
- This is the top part of the switch that connects to the key caps
- **Cherry MX Stems**:
   - the most typical stem
   - shape of a plus symbol `+` that protrudes out
- **Some Kailh/Gateron low profile switch**:
   - This stem has 2 vertical rectangles holes `| |`
   - This is on some Kailh and Gateron low profile switches (other low profile switches have MX stems)
- **Box Stems**:
   - A box (can be square `[ ]` or round `( )`) and goes around the core stem for extra stability

## Pins

- The pins of the switch will be parts that get inserted into the PCB
- There will be 2 electrical pins that allow the PCB to register when the switch actuates
- The other will be stabilizing pins that help secure the switch to the board
- Pin counts
   - **3 pins**
      - 2 pins for contact to detect actuation
      - 1 pin (plastic) at center for stability
      - these switches are plate mounted
   - **5 pins**
      - 2 pins for contacts to detect actuation
      - 1 pin (plastic) at center + 2 pins (plastic) on each side for stability
      - these switches are typically PCB mounted
      - can be converted to 3 pin / plate mounted by cutting 2 side pins
   - **1 pin**
      - 1 pin (plastic) at center for stability
      - these are only for optical switches that do no need the electrical pins (has an optical mechanisms that requires specific support from the PCB)

**Note**
- Some low profile switches have different pin positions and are not compatible with all boards

- **Orthorlinear**: keys are in straight vertical columns (not staggered)
- **Split**: keyboard split into left and right sides (for ergonomics)
   - with tent option: allows tilting the left section to the left / right section to the right for extra ergonoimcs

## Layouts
- **ISO**: International Organization for Standardization
   - mainly used in European countries
   - `Enter` key: 2 row height and shape of upside down L shaped
   - `Backslash` / '\` key: on the left on `Enter` or right of Left `Shift`
   - Left `Shift` is shorter `1u` width
   - Right `Alt` is an `Alt Gr`
   - 105 keys for full size / 88 for tenkeyless / 69 for 60%
- **ANSI**: American National Standards Institute
   - used in US and more globally
   - `Enter` key: 1 row height
   - `Backslash` / '\` key: above `Enter`
   - Left `Shift` is longer
   - `Backslash` is to the left to `Enter`
   - 104 keys for full size / 87 for tenkeyless / 68 Keys for 60%


## Keycaps
- Keycaps are placed onto of the switch itself and is what users see and interface with the keyboard

### Sizes
   - `1u`: width and height of a regular square keycap
   - Some typicaly widths
      - `2u`: Backspace
      - `1.5u`: Tab, Backslash (ANSI layout)
      - `1.75`: Caps lock
      - `2.25u`: Enter
      - `2.25u`: Left Shift (ANSI layout)
      - `2.75u`: Right Shift
      - `1.25u`: Ctrl, Alt, Win/OS/Meta keys
      - `6.25u`: Space bar

### Material
- Types:
   - **ABS**: smooth and gets shiny over time
   - **PBT**: textured and does not get shiny, more durable
- Other terminology:
   - **Doubleshot keycaps**: made of 2 different plastics
      - legends (the character on the key cap) won't wear over time as they are part of the keycap
      - can allow for RGB/lights to shiney through the key
   - **Pudding keycaps**:
      - doubleshot and the side of keys have 2 layers
      - bottom layer more transparent/translucent to allow more light through and typically
      - top layer opaque

### Profiles
   - https://www.keycaps.info/
   - https://teksbit.com/keycap-profiles-guide/
   - The shape / heights of the keycaps based on the row the key is on
      - **Sculpted**: keys slightly angled for extra comfort
      - **Uniform**: all rows same height
   - Some profiles from tallest to shortests (for regular non low-profile keycaps)
      - **SA**: sculpted, concave keys, convex space
      - **MT3**: sculpted, concave keys, flat space
      - **KAT**: sculpted, concave keys, convex space
      - **OEM**: sculpted, flat but angled keys, convex space
      - **Cherry**: sculpted, flat but angled keys, convex space, convex space
      - **XDA**: uniform, concave keys, convex space
      - **KAM**: uniform, concave keys including  space
      - **DSA**: uniform, concave keys, convex space

## Mount types

- Switches can be mounted in various places
- **PCB mounted**: mounted on the PCB
- **Plate mounted**: a plate exists on top of the PCB for extra stability

### Mounting styles
- **Bottom mount**: traditional where the plate/PCB mounted to bottom of the case
- **Top mount**: plate mounted to top of case
- **Gasket mount**: plate mounted between a top and bottom gasket layer to insulate and provide a softened typing experience

## Stabilizers

- For keys `2u` and longer there are extra stablizers that have stems so the keycap is more stable

## Lighting / RGB

- Key switches have a see through hole
- For keyboards that have lighting/RGB the orietnation of the switch to have the hole on the top of the bottom can have different results
   - **North facing**
      - when switch see through hole is on the top
      - light typically shines through legends (which are at typically at the top part of the key cap)
      - Cherry profile key caps interfere when bottoming out and will sound and feel different
   - **South facing**
      - when switch see through hole is on the bottom
      - light typically shines through bottom of key cap, so dimmer at legends (which are at typically at the top part of the key cap)

## Layers, Macros, Programmability

- `Fn` key to allow access to the keys that are not available directly
   - Usually found on 65% and smaller keyboards
- `Fn` key behaviour can vary
   - **`Shift`-like behaviour**:
      - Press `Fn` key and another key to get missing function
      - e.g. `Fn` + right `Shift` = Arrow Up)
   - **Cycling/Toggling Layer behaviour**:
      - pressing `Fn` can cycle between layers
      - may have multiple layers
      - e.g. Pressing `Fn` key will activate layer one which will allow for right Shift, right Alt, right Ctrl and right OS keys to behaviour like arrow keys. Pressing `Fn` key again will cycle back to normal behaviour (or if there are multiple layers it will go to the next layer)
- Programmability
   - Some keyboards are programmable via
      - Firmware on keyboard itself
      - Software installed on computer
   - This will allow recording things like
      - macros
      - remapping buttons
      - customizing layers
   - Some popular custom firmware
      - [QMK](https://qmk.fm/)
      - [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/)

## Connectivity

- Most keyboards are wired USB
   - Some have USB-C ports but will only work with USB-A (connected to computer) to USB-C cables and do not work with USB-C to USB-C cables. To support USB-C to USB-C cables, the PCB requires extra circuitry to support it
   - Some have detactable cables
- Some have wireless options via RF / Bluetooth
- Some have multi device support (i.e. being able to connect to multiple devices with manually pairing again)
   - Most with multi device support allow switching devices at the click of a button combination (some like the [Filco Majestouch MINILA Air](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=1471) do not allow manual switch - auto detects)


## Sound and Feel

- One part of mechnical keyboards is the sound and feel of using them
- Some modding options
   - **O-rings**:
      - placed on the bottom of keycaps and will
         - absorb pressure when bottoming out
         - shorten key travel to bottoming out
         - reduce sound of bottoming out
      - has different hardness and thickness which will change the characteristis above
   - **Lube**:
      - can be placed on stablizers, springs, stems
      - reduces friction/scratchiness to make it feel smoother and quieter
   - **Foam/Tape**:
      - used to fill in the insides of a case to dampen sound

## Other info
- `NKRO`: N-Key Rollover (NKRO)
   - All keys can be pressed simulationeous and be recognized correctly
- `#KRO`: where `#` is an actual number e.g. `2KRO` / `6KRO`
   - It means that it can recognize that number of keys pressed at the same time
   - If more keys are pressed
      - not all of them will be recognized
      - or sometimes it will cause `Ghosting` where an unintended key press is sent
